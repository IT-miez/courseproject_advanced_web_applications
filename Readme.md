# Course-project / Forum for posting issues with one's code

This is my course project for the course "Advanced Web Applications".</br></br>
In this application you can look posts and their comments, or by making an account, do posts and comments yourself. You can make posts with code blocks in them to automatically highlight variable names etc. for better visibility. You can delete your posts and comments as well. You can also see your profile information while you are signed in.</br>
A similar site with more features and better UI is **currently** being developed by me: ⚙️[REPOSITORY](https://github.com/IT-miez/blog-api-project/)</br>

## What I learned
This project is my first small fullstack application. I learned to use my web development skills on a bigger fullstack project. I got an idea how such a site could be implemented and structured. I implemented tests to check if the basic functionalities of the site worked fine.</br>
