## README MD

This is my course project.

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROJECT

clone the repository

open terminal
cd server and run "npm install", then "npm run dev"

open another terminal
cd client and run "npm install", then "npm start"

client should open on localhost:3000
server should be open on localhost:1234 and client should proxy to it



! NOTE ! 
There might be some proxy error which is why the project might not run after following the steps above. 
I provided a video to showcase the site and my cypress tests in case that happens.
Link is found in the sharepoint-link and also here: (youtube) https://youtu.be/p1Qmgj8Colw
